# Classifying_IrisFlowers_using_DecisionTrees

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each from one of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These flowers are characterized by four features:

1. Sepal Length (in centimeters)
2. Sepal Width (in centimeters)
3. Petal Length (in centimeters)
4. Petal Width (in centimeters)

The goal of using a decision tree with the Iris dataset is typically to classify the iris flowers into their correct species based on these features. Here's how you can use a decision tree for this task:

1. *Data Preparation*: First, you would split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. This allows you to train the decision tree on a portion of the data and then evaluate its performance on unseen data.

2. *Training*: You would use the training data to build the decision tree. The tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data based on the features that best separate the different iris species. The splitting criteria are determined using metrics like Gini impurity or information gain.

3. *Prediction*: Once the decision tree is trained, you can use it to make predictions on the testing data. The tree's internal nodes represent decisions based on the feature values, and the leaf nodes represent the predicted iris species.

4. *Evaluation*: Finally, you would evaluate the performance of the decision tree using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score to assess how well it classifies the iris flowers into their correct species.

The decision tree algorithm aims to create a tree structure that optimally separates the different iris species based on the provided features, allowing it to classify new iris flowers accurately. It's a simple yet powerful algorithm for classification tasks like this.
